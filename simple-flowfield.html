        <p>This version was also based on the idea from Daniel Shiffman, but authored by Hirnschall Sebastian, then further modified by me.</p>

        <p>The flowfield concept is the same but Sebastian was able to add particles as a function called every draw loop. The velocity is determined by sine, cosine and noise.</p>
        <p>The main difference from my implementation is that this flowfield is static, but changes on every reload due to the noise function. I think this is okay since my data is also static. The next step would be to introduce the colour changing particles idea - a particle lights up if on its iteration, the datapoint at that index is above a certain amount.</p>
