    <h3>initial ideas</h3>
    <p>Below is my formative assignment presentation. It details my two first ideas and how I would go about realising them. After receiving feedback I'm deciding to go forward with the Arduino project: visualising electrical signals sent by fungi to communicate with each other.</p> 
    <p>Since I'm focusing on the web in another class, I want to challenge myself by using a medium I haven't had much time to play with. I'm expecting the circuitry to be simple but the data processing to be difficult because of my inexperience.</p>

    <h3>planning</h3>
    <p>Using <a href="https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer/">WebPlotDigitizer</a> I can extract numerical data from graphs showing spikes in electrical activity of studied fungi over time. Then I need to find some way to map this data onto HIGH, LOW values when writing to the LEDS. Once I see the ranges in the numerical data I can decide on how those ranges translate into 1s and 0s. I'll start with a signal LED at first and then increase the number of them and the complexity</p>
