        <h1>perlin noise flowfield</h1>
        <a href="simple-flowfield.html">simplified ver.</a>
        <p>The basis of this code came from a video by Daniel Shiffman creating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjoM9oKOAKY&ab_channel=TheCodingTrain">a Perlin noise flowfield</a>. Perlin noise is a noise function created by Ken Perlin. He developed it for the original Tron movie and won an Academy Award for it. Unlike pure randomness, Perlin noise gives a sequence of numbers that are more related, so the differences between each iteration are a lot smaller. This helps produce more organic outputs like terrains and clouds. This is why I thought it would be useful for creating the vector field that I had tried to create previously with pixel processing.</p>
        
        <div id="flow-container"></div>
        <p>As you can see above there is a flowfield successfully rendering but I couldn't figure out how to drop pixels onto the canvas. I still think the field looks interesting, like blades of grass blowing in the breeze. I could maybe use the Flowfield class in another way. Nevertheless, this led me to further research where I found someone had implemented the same thing but in a much simpler way (the link at the top of the page).</p>

        <p>This is a pretty version where I didn't refresh the background for every frame.</p>
