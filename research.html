    <h3>the electric fungi</h3>
    <p>In 2022, Andrew Adamatzky conducted a study that shed light on the fascinating communication abilities of fungi. The study revealed that fungi employ electrical spikes as a form of communication to process information. By analyzing these electrical spikes, Adamatzky and his team were able to identify patterns and group them into clusters, which they referred to as "words" in the fungal language. Remarkably, they found that the lengths of these fungal words could match those observed in human languages. This groundbreaking discovery opened up new possibilities for research and exploration in various fields. The identification of communication patterns in fungi could inspire further investigations into bioelectronic devices, sensors, and advancements in our understanding of the physiological states and changes that fungi undergo (Adamatzky et. al, 2021). These studies acted as catalysts for my project, sparking a deep interest in fungi and mycelium and highlighting the remarkable abilities of these organisms and their significance in various scientific, ecological, and technological domains.</p>

    <h3>fungal superhighways</h3>
    <p>Mycorrhizal fungal networks, also known as fungal superhighways, refer to the extensive interconnected networks of fungal hyphae that permeate the soil or other substrates. This is the system I want to simulate in my work. These networks are formed by filamentous fungi and play crucial roles in various ecosystems. The term nutrient cycling is ascribed to a phenomenon of symbiotic associations with plants, where the hyphae is extended into the soil and make connection with plant roots. Through these connections, fungi can access nutrients, such as phosphorus and nitrogen, that may be otherwise inaccessible to plants. The fungal hyphae transport these nutrients over long distances, effectively redistributing them and enhancing nutrient availability for plants and other organisms (Barto, 2012). This sharing of resources and communication promotes the establishment of mutually beneficial associations, such as mycorrhizal symbioses. These cooperative interactions enhance the resilience and productivity of ecosystems. On a cellular level, the filamentous fungi are able to mediate attraction between the cells of different species, and their subsequent physical contact, allowing them to compose a form of "signalling machinery" through which reprogramming of the cells can occur (Hammadeh et. al, 2022).</p>

    <p>These fungal networks have even been compared to our own neural networks. Large spikes in electrical activity during mycorrhizal communicatons are not unlike those previously observed in the central nervous systems of humans and other mammals (Adamatzky, 2022). Simard (2018) proposes the foundation for a more holistic approach to ecological studies by providing examples of "tree behavioral, learning, and memory responses facilitated by communication through mycorrhizal networks". There are interactions amongst many agents such as trees, fungi, salmon, bears, and humans that are memory based and facilitated by fungi, creating microbiome collaborations and forest intelligence.</p>
