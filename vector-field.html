    <h1>vector-field test</h1>
    <p>For this idea I was imagining something that worked like a lake with hidden undercurrents. Particles move idly around in calm waters but move at different velocities when taken by a current. In this test the mushroom's body is the lake and the patterned lines are the undercurrents.</p>

    <p>The plan is to: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>SCAN the image for points of high contrast.</li>
        <li>SPLIT the canvas into columns and rows.</li>
        <li>MAP the high contrast points onto the grid.</li>
        <li>ADD vectors at index points throughout [cols * rows].</li>
        <li>ADD particles onto the vector field.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Then process the data in such a way to "light up" said particles at different intervals around the field.</p>

    <p>I got this code from <a href="https://fiveko.com/image-edge-detection-with-simple-javascript/"> here </a> but couldn't get it to draw an image. This led me to repurposing code that I had already used in my sound and image processing module, shown below is its respective output.</p>
    
    <canvas id="canvas1"></canvas>
    <script src="addons/edges.js"></script>   
    <img src="img/convolve.png" style="height:600px">
    <p>After creating a program that processes pixels to find the edges in an image, I realised doing it with code was unnecessary. The pixels only matter once the image is turned into this black and white contrast. Then I use the pixels in the contrasted image to create the vector field. There may be information within the convolve function that I could use in the next steps but I think there was a faster way for me to achieve the same results. Still I took away a lot about image processing from this exercise.</p>

    <img src="img/sobel-feldman.png" style="height:600px">
    <img src="img/laplacian.png" style="height:600px">
    <p>I converted the image to it's edges with an <a href="https://pinetools.com/image-edge-detection">online editor</a>, which only took a few minutes to use. They use the Roberts cross, Sobel-Feldman, and Laplacian processes in order. I can crop these images to just the mushroom and not the tree bark, and make a program that only generates vectors at the black lines seen in the images. I'm going to use the Laplacian output because of the lack of other colours, I think this will make it easier to process.</p>
    <canvas id="canvas2"></canvas>
    <script src="addons/contrast.js"></script>

    <img src="img/find-contrast.png" style="width:600px">
    <p>In this function I'm scanning each pixel from the Laplacian output image. By checking wether the value is below a certain threshold (in this instance I decided 10 was low enough) I can determine wether the pixel is black. This is because RGBA values range from 0-255, 0 representing blackness. Then I added the pixel to an array. I can then use this array as a kind of map for my vector field.</p>

    <img src="img/create-vector-field.png" style="width:600px">
    <p>I take in the blackPixels array as a parameter for the next function. The x,y points of the vector are based on each blackPixel but I don't think they are situated within the context of the entire canvas. When I log the output, I know it is creating an array of length 48000. Creating a visual output would help me better understand this code. I could do this by "dropping" particles onto the vector field to add colour.</p>
